    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my mother-tongue language, <strong>&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;</strong> is pronounced as &ldquo;xiao ren&rdquo;. The meaning is small people
.</p>

<blockquote><p>It refers to people whom you consider offensive,
or as some sort of a foil to you. Almost like a nemesis, except that he or she will never
deserves your respect because of their conniving ways.</p></blockquote>

<h2>My own tests for &ldquo;Little People&rdquo; are when they:</h2>

<ul>
<li>dig information to their advantage without regards to your feeling</li>
<li>talks only about themselves</li>
<li>complain about work being stressful but still have free time to loiter / take a cigarette break</li>
<li>do things that hurts friendship</li>
<li>push work around even when it&rsquo;s clearly within their job scope</li>
</ul>


<h2>So how do ancient chinese handles this?</h2>

<p>They will paste a piece of paper that is shaped like a man or woman onto the back of their
sandal. The name of their foil will also be written on the paper. Next as you may have
guessed is to smack the sandal with the figurine paper hard on the ground.</p>

<p>The effect on the foil? Usually negligible. Folklore goes that some may complain of sneezing, which
they will naturally conclude that someone is scolding them behind their backs. But to the
person inflicting the &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, psychological bliss ensues.</p>

<p>How does your culture deal with such people?</p>

<p>Now, why would I suddenly broached this subject. Maybe because someone <em>passed</em> my tests of a
&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;. Haha.</p>
