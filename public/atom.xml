    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Android developer documents states that the baseline screen density is taken to be 160 pixels (px) per
inch. If your device has 240 px per inch (high density), a image of size 100px by 100px will appear larger on the baseline
baseline screen than the high density screen. Specially, the image will be 0.625 of an inch on baseline screen compared to
0.416 inch on the higher density screen.</p>

<p>Then how does <em>image dpi</em> relates to how Android serves up the image. The answer as I have researched is <strong>NOTHING</strong>.
Turns out the image dpi has no bearing on how large the images are displayed on the computer or cellphone screen.
It does however specify how large these images are printed on paper. For example, two images of 100px by 100px but at different
dpi of 200 dpi and 100 dpi will look the same size on the same cellphone screen. However, when printed,
the one with the higher dpi will print as half the dimension as the other.</p>

<p>You can refer to this <a href="http://www.scantips.com/no72dpi.html">scantips</a> for more on image dpi.</p>

<p>For us Android developers, we just have to stop worrying about image dpi. If only we
can do the same for screen density&hellip;lol.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was dabbling with implementing <em>In App Purchase (IAB)</em>  for my Android app. According to Google documentation,
it would be best to change the UI instantly once the purchase was successful. However, this is not possible
for my app unless after a restart.</p>

<p>The documentation also advised to do a server query for the purchased item status every so often, preferably
everytime the app is started.</p>

<p>How I implemented my part of my app&rsquo;s IAB workflow is as such:</p>

<ol>
<li>User makes the purchase, but the UI of the app will only update after the next app&rsquo;s start up.</li>
<li>If the User download the app on his other devices for the first time, app will need to check for his
purchases before going into the main UI.</li>
</ol>


<p>The above use cases led me to implement a splash screen activity that will always run before my main UI activity.
However I have some optimizing to shorten the on screen time of this splash screen. After all, who likes to wait?</p>

<p>Some of the design choices to cut waiting time are:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the purchase transaction first came through, I would set a flag in the app to note this event.</li>
<li>Then I forced the app to shutdown and prompt the user to <em>restart</em> the app with a Toast message.</li>
<li>At the next start-up, the splash screen <code>onCreate()</code> code will check for the presence of the flag.

<ul>
<li>If the flag exists, the splashscreen quickly starts the main UI activity.</li>
<li>If not, this start-up could be the first start up on a device that newly install the app.

<ul>
<li>So the splashscreen activity will check with Google Play Services for any purchases. In this case
the splash screen may dwell longer on the screen becauses of server calls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>To make the splash screen as unintrusive as possible, I also styled the activity using the
<code>android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog</code> in the application manifest.</p>

    <id>http://nutshellworld.herokuapp.com/blog/2013/08/28/css-jargons-span-element-vs-block-element</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It finally <em>dawn</em> on me that my understanding of &ldquo;span&rdquo; in the context of CSS or markdown has
nothing to do with &ldquo;length&rdquo;. Rather it means that the &ldquo;span&rdquo; element is supposed to be inline with
other elements. The opposite of a span element is a block element, which is like an element that wants
to stand alone.</p>

<p>Now I finally understand the difference between <strong>code span</strong> and <strong>code block</strong> while reading the

    <id>http://nutshellworld.herokuapp.com/blog/2013/08/28/simple-json-array-to-string</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Supposed you have the following json array</p>

<p><code>{&ldquo;apple&rdquo;:&ldquo;twelve&rdquo;, &ldquo;banana&rdquo;: &ldquo;three&rdquo;, &ldquo;oranges&rdquo;: &ldquo;five&rdquo;}</code>, how do you extract the value
of &ldquo;oranges&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;five&rdquo;?</p>

<p>As simple as this sounds, this took me awhile to figure using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">GSON</a>.</p>

<pre><code>JsonElement jelement = new JsonParser().parse(purchaseInfo);                
result = jelement.getAsJsonObject().get("oranges").getAsString();
</code></pre>

<p>Now <em>result</em> will contains the string &ldquo;five&rdquo;. That was easy! The above was used in my Google
App Engine app.</p>

<p>In English, this would be: &ldquo;the array is a json object with the json object of property &#8220;oranges&rdquo;.
Once I have the &ldquo;orange&rdquo; object, give me it&rsquo;s string value which is &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.requestmaker.com">Request Maker</a> allows you to send GET/POST/GET/PUT/DELETE request to any web url. I was particularly
interested in its ability to send Post messages to my Google App Engine app.</p>

<p>For example, if I want to send foo=bar&amp;mad=man as the request body, I just have to typed
<code>foo=bar&amp;mad=man</code> verbertim into the Request Data form input at request maker.</p>

<p>However, I had difficulty extracting these key-values at Google App Engine using
the <code>request.getParameter(&ldquo;foo&rdquo;)</code> code.</p>

<p>Turns out for it all to work, you need to set the request header&rsquo;s content-type to</p>

<blockquote><p>application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8</p></blockquote>

<p>That helped me and I hope it helps you.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Growth stock has potential for continued growth</p></li>
<li><p>Value stock are underpriced by the market and have potential for an increase
when the market corrects the price</p></li>
<li><p>Return on Equity (ROE)</p>

<ul>
<li>Measure of how efficiently a company uses its assets to produce Earnings

<ul>
<li>is Net Income divided by Book Value

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am the developer for a small note taking app called <strong>Dog Writer</strong>. It&rsquo;s allows you to write your thoughts in plain text and sync them to Dropbox .</p>

<p>Now I never thought that anything would be better than text to allow focused writing. <strong>UNTIL</strong> today. It all started with a little dabbling with Octopress. Hail as the blog engine for hackers, it let users type out their blogs in Markdown.</p>

<blockquote><p>Markdown is the new Rich Text format (RTF) equivalent. It allows the writer to effortlessly format their writing without using mouse or ugly TAGS.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very tempted to integrate this function into Dog Writer. It could well be the killer app. Good use of my time?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Manage to integrate in a markdown preview window.</p>

<p>Other possible enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<li>save as md</li>
<li>ads removal</li>

    <id>http://nutshellworld.herokuapp.com/blog/2013/08/22/little-people</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my mother-tongue language, <strong>&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;</strong> is pronounced as &ldquo;xiao ren&rdquo;. The meaning is small people
.</p>

<blockquote><p>It refers to people whom you consider offensive,
or as some sort of a foil to you. Almost like a nemesis, except that he or she will never
deserves your respect because of their conniving ways.</p></blockquote>

<h2>My own tests for &ldquo;Little People&rdquo; are when they:</h2>

<ul>
<li>dig information to their advantage without regards to your feeling</li>
<li>talks only about themselves</li>
<li>complain about work being stressful but still have free time to loiter / take a cigarette break</li>
<li>do things that hurts friendship</li>
<li>push work around even when it&rsquo;s clearly within their job scope</li>
</ul>


<h2>So how do ancient chinese handles this?</h2>

<p>They will paste a piece of paper that is shaped like a man or woman onto the back of their
sandal. The name of their foil will also be written on the paper. Next as you may have
guessed is to smack the sandal with the figurine paper hard on the ground.</p>

<p>The effect on the foil? Usually negligible. Folklore goes that some may complain of sneezing, which
they will naturally conclude that someone is scolding them behind their backs. But to the
person inflicting the &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, psychological bliss ensues.</p>

<p>How does your culture deal with such people?</p>

<p>Now, why would I suddenly broached this subject. Maybe because someone <em>passed</em> my tests of a
&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;. Haha.</p>
