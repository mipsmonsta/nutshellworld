    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my mother-tongue language, <strong>&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;</strong> is pronounced as &ldquo;xiao ren&rdquo;. The meaning is small people
.</p>

<blockquote><p>It refers to people whom you consider offensive,
or as some sort of a foil to you. Almost like a nemesis, except that he or she will never
deserves your respect because of their conniving ways.</p></blockquote>

<h2>My own tests for &ldquo;Little People&rdquo; are when they:</h2>

<ul>
<li>dig information to their advantage without regards to your feeling</li>
<li>talks only about themselves</li>
<li>complain about work being stressful but still have free time to loiter / take a cigarette break</li>
<li>do things that hurts friendship</li>
<li>push work around even when it&rsquo;s clearly within their job scope</li>
</ul>


<h2>So how do ancient chinese handles this?</h2>

<p>They will paste a piece of paper that is shaped like a man or woman onto the back of their
sandal. The name of their foil will also be written on the paper. Next as you may have
guessed is to smack the sandal with the figurine paper hard on the ground.</p>

<p>The effect on the foil? Usually negligible. Folklore goes that some may complain of sneezing, which
they will naturally conclude that someone is scolding them behind their backs. But to the
person inflicting the &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, psychological bliss ensues.</p>

<p>How does your culture deal with such people?</p>

<p>Now, why would I suddenly broached this subject. Maybe because someone <em>passed</em> my tests of a
&ldquo;Little People&rdquo;. Haha.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the _config.yml file, you can link to twitter under <em>Third Party Setting</em>.
However I had difficulty when calling rake generate. The latter will complain that the
token on line 71 is somehow causing parsing errors.</p>

<p>How I solve it is to put my username for twitter between quotes.</p>

<p><code>
twitter_user: &ldquo;johndoe"<br/>
twitter_tweet_button: true</p>

<p></code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>First Post</h2>

<p>What should a first post talks about. Maybe why I am blogging? The short answers is that I was toying with launch a blog using a ruby blogging engine. The long answers is maybe I felt that I need to have a better reflections of my life thus far.</p>

<p>What ever the reason, here is the <em>first post</em>. The one that started it all.</p>

<p>My resolution for my future posts:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Informative or <em>value adding</em>.</li>
<li>Fun.</li>
<li>True to the heart.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
