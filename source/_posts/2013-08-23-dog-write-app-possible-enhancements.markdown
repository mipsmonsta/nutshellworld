I am the developer for a small note taking app called **Dog Writer**. It's allows you to write your thoughts in plain text and sync them to Dropbox . 

Now I never thought that anything would be better than text to allow focused writing. **UNTIL** today. It all started with a little dabbling with Octopress. Hail as the blog engine for hackers, it let users type out their blogs in Markdown. 

>Markdown is the new Rich Text format (RTF) equivalent. It allows the writer to effortlessly format their writing without using mouse or ugly TAGS. 

Very tempted to integrate this function into Dog Writer. It could well be the killer app. Good use of my time? 

**Update**: Manage to integrate in a markdown preview window.

Other possible enhancements:

+ save as md
+ ads removal
+ syntax help
