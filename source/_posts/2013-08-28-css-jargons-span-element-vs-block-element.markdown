It finally *dawn* on me that my understanding of "span" in the context of CSS or markdown has 
nothing to do with "length". Rather it means that the "span" element is supposed to be inline with
other elements. The opposite of a span element is a block element, which is like an element that wants
to stand alone.

Now I finally understand the difference between **code span** and **code block** while reading the 
[markdown guide][1]
