Trying to get a handle on some stock market terms... here we go
-----------------------------------------------------------------

+ Outstanding shares of its stock, that is shares held by the public outside of its control

+ EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and measures 
operating performance of a company before accounting conventions and non-operational 
charges (such as taxes and interest)
	- Interest Coverage 
	  - Gives a good idea if a company is having trouble paying off its 
	      interest charges on its debt
	      - Formula is EBITDA / Interest Expense = Interest Coverage
	      - 1.5 times to be subjectively deemed healthy
		          
+ Growth stock has potential for continued growth

+ Value stock are underpriced by the market and have potential for an increase
when the market corrects the price

+ Return on Equity (ROE) 
  + Measure of how efficiently a company uses its assets to produce Earnings
    + is Net Income divided by Book Value
      + Flaws:
      	+ when companies lowers Book Value by taking on debt 
	  + accounting sleight of hand that reduces book value
	    + write-downs
	      + stock buy backs

+ Book Value = **Assets - Liabilities**
  + How much left if a company shutters after selling all assets and settling all debts
  
+ PEG = P/E /(projected growth in earnings)
  + For example, a stock with a P/E of 30 and projected earning growth next year of 15% would have a PEG of 2 (30 / 15 = 2).
  + its about y-o-y earning Growth
  + relies on projections, which may not always be accurate
  
+ Price to Sale = Market Cap / Revenue or Stock Price / Sales Price Per Share
  + Useful for evaluating youung companies without historical earnings
  + Lower the better
  
+ Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividents Per Share / Earning per Shares
