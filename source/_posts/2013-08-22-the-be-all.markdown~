First Post
---------

What should a first post talks about. Maybe why I am blogging? The short answers is that I was toying with launch a blog using a ruby blogging engine. The long answers is maybe I felt that I need to have a better reflections of my life thus far. 

What ever the reason, here is the *first post*. The one that started it all. 

My resolution for my future posts:

+ Informative or *value adding*.
+ Fun.
+ True to the heart.
